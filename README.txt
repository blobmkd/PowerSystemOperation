%INTRODUCTION%
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello there!

So in this project I'm simply submitting problems and solutions to those problems in either Excel VBA or MATLAB
from the subject "Power System Operations" for the field of Power System Engineering.

Most of the problems and the subsequent solutions will be with detailed steps on how to approach the solutions,
how to do the needed steps and if there are any other ways to better the solutions to the given problems.

Most of the time I will be also uploading a form of report for the problem as that is the professional custom
in the world of electrical engineering.

%NOTE%
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All of the problems and solutions in this repo are done during the course of my studies.
Because I am still not an engineer, nor am I quite experienced, do take most of the solutions with a bit of a reserve.
Mistakes are possible and I would appreciate it if you would contact me if you were to find any.
Thank you.
